The items contained in `extracted-knowledge/` have the following naming convention: `<model_name>-<boolean>-<boolean>-<boolean>-<boolean>-knowledge-extraction` with no extension for directories and `.csv` for files. The four booleans represent the following configurations:

1. Schema Provision (Complete = True, Modules = False)  
2. Schema Pruning (Yes = True, No = False)  
3. Literature Pruning (Yes = True, No = False)  
4. Example Provision (Yes = True, No = False)
