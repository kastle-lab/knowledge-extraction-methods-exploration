Abstract The incorporation of silica nanoparticles
into polyethylene has been shown to increase the
breakdown strength significantly compared to composites with micron scale fillers. Additionally, the voltage
endurance of the nanocomposites is two orders of
magnitude higher than that of the base polymer. The
most significant difference between micron-scale and
nano-scale fillers is the large interfacial area in nanocomposites. Because the interfacial region (interaction
zone) is likely to be pivotal in controlling properties,
this paper compares the behavior of nanoscale silica/
cross-linked low density polyethylene nanocomposites
with several silica surface treatments. In addition to

breakdown strength and voltage endurance, dielectric
spectroscopy, absorption current measurements, and
thermally stimulated current determinations (TSC)
were performed to elucidate the role of the interface.
It was found that a reduction in the mobility in
nanocomposites as well as a change in the defect size
may be key to explaining the improvement in the
properties.

Introduction


Nanocomposite-dielectrics, or nanodielectrics, can exhibit dielectric properties that are better than the base
polymer and significantly better than conventional
composites with micron scale filler. For example, an
increase in dielectric strength and an accompanying
reduction in space charge has been documented for the
case of nano-TiO 2 filled epoxy resin compared to
micron scale TiO 2 filled epoxy composites [1] and
titania filled low density polyethylene (LDPE) composites compared to micron scale TiO 2 filled LDPE
composites [2]. In the nano-TiO 2 filled epoxy composites, the electrical voltage endurance was three orders
of magnitude higher than that of the base resin [3]. The
improvements in nanocomposite electrical behavior
have been attributed to (i) changes in the space charge
distribution [4, 5], (ii) a reduction in the internal field
caused by the decrease in particle size, and (iii)
changes in the polymer morphology [2].
The particle–polymer interface is critical in determining the properties of nano-filled materials because
at the same particle loading, nanocomposites have a
much greater interfacial area than microcomposites.
Since a significant percentage of polymer will be in
these interfacial areas (zones), the properties of the
overall composite will be dominated by the interfacial
properties [6] even at low volume fractions of filler [7,
8]. Some authors have emphasized that the interaction
zone around the particles is a ‘‘quasi-conductive’’
region that partially overlaps in the nanocomposites

[9]. These overlapped interface regions may allow
charge dissipation, which, in turn, could be expected to
improve the dielectric breakdown strength and voltage
endurance characteristics by improving the internal

electric field distribution. It has been shown that when
the size of the filler approaches the chain conformation
length, they act ‘cooperatively’ with the host structure
either eliminating or suppressing Maxwell–Wagner
polarization, which is well known in the case of
conventionally filled materials [1]. Introduction of a
second phase can also influence the breakdown
strength of the dielectrics via a scattering mechanism

[10] (i.e., a decrease in path length of the carriers
responsible for the breakdown processes), or by
changing the space charge distribution [11].
Although the importance of the size of the filler in
determining the global properties (electrical, mechanical and thermal) is undeniable [12], the chemistry of
the particle surface is also critical. The addition of
molecules that are more or less compatible with the
matrix and with a polar or non-polar nature will impact
the breakdown strength. In addition, the changes in
morphology due to incorporating nanoparticles, particularly for semicrystalline polymers are of enormous
importance [13, 14]. The breakdown strength of the
intraspherulitic regions is higher than that of the
interspherulitic regions and a change in the disorder
within the spherulites or of the interspherulitic region
can affect the breakdown strength.
The promise of unique electrical properties due to
the mechanisms just described provides an incentive for
investigating the dielectric properties of nano-filled
materials. This study of a silica/cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) system [15] has found a significant increase
in breakdown strength in the nanoscale composites as
well as a two orders of magnitude increase in the
voltage endurance compared to the unfilled XLPE.
Using XPS (X-ray photoemission spectroscopy) and
EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) to characterize the interface, as well as dielectric spectroscopy and
space charge measurements to understand the internal
electrical response, two main differences between the
nanofilled and micron filled materials that were relevant have been hypothesized. First, in the case of
untreated fillers, it appears that there may be a quasiconductive region surrounding the nanoparticles that
provided an opportunity for charge dissipation. This is
supported by the dielectric spectroscopy data. Second,



the covalent bonding between functionalized nanoparticles and the XLPE was one of the keys to the
improved voltage endurance. It has been concluded
that any changes in crystallinity were not the primary
mechanism controlling dielectric breakdown.
In this paper, some of the earlier results are
reviewed to provide an opportunity to compare the
behavior for several different interface conditions.

Additionally, new results on the absorption current
and thermally stimulated depolarization provide some
understanding of the silica/XLPE system. A statistical
analysis of the data using defect size distribution
provides further insight into the electrical failure
behavior. Finally, by drawing on the full set of data,
some conclusions are advanced about the dominant

mechanisms controlling dielectric breakdown and
voltage endurance of nanofilled polymers.


Systems investigated


Polyethylene–SiO 2 composites were formulated using
micron and nanoscale particulates. The base polyethylene used for the matrix is a commercially available
material used in the manufacturing of high-voltage
(HV) extruded cross-linked underground cables. It
contains antioxidants (non-ionic and hence, do not
contribute to the base polymer conductivity) and a
cross-linking agent, dicumyl peroxide (DCP), which
reacts at temperatures above the compounding temperature creating a cross-linked matrix.
The nanosilica was either used untreated or

was commercially surface-modified with triethoxyvinylsilane (TES), n-(2-aminoethyl) 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AEAPS), or hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS). The structures of these compounds are
depicted in Fig. 1. AEAPS and HMDS are both polar
molecules creating an incompatible interface with the
XLPE and possibly causing scattering or charge trapping. TES is non-polar and provides an opportunity for
covalent bonding (and thus a strong interface) with the
matrix. Prior work [15] showed that the vinylsilane
treatment indeed resulted in covalent bonding between
the particles and the polymer.

The particles and polyethylene were melt mixed
until the aggregate size was less than 100 nm as
measured using scanning electron microscopy. All the
composites were loaded with 5 wt% of nanoparticles.
The details of sample formulations are discussed in

[15]. In brief, the particles were vacuum dried for 24 h
immediately prior to compounding. All samples were
created by hot pressing, and then allowed to cool
slowly to room temperature, keeping the pressure
constant. The samples were post-cured under vacuum
which is important since cross-linking byproducts may
otherwise affect the electrical properties. The samples
meant for electrical testing were metallized with
~150 A [˚ ] of sputtered gold. Melt processing and postcure annealing are likely to mitigate the presence of
pre-existing electric charge.


Characterization of particles


Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were
used to detect differences in the particle defect density
as a function of surface treatment and composite
compounding. All the powdered silica samples and
composites (cryo-crushed) were measured using a
Bruker ER 042 EPR spectrometer. In the simplest
case, the resonance condition is given by:


Hm ¼ gbH; ð1Þ


where H is the magnetic field, b is the Bohr magneton,
and m is the frequency of the microwave radiation, and
g is the Lande factor. For a spin only electron,
g = 2.0023. The magnetic field was measured using a
Walker Hall probe Tesla meter, the instrument being
set at one value using the resonance of diphenyl picryl
hydrazyl (dpph), which has a g value of 2.0034, as a
standard. The magnetic field values are accurate to
within 0.01%. The spectrometer measures the derivative of the absorption at X-band, the frequency, being
in the range 9.77 GHz.
We show the derivative spectrum of untreated silica
nanoparticles (Fig. 2). This spectrum is typical of all
spectra obtained from our different samples. The
overall magnitude in the spectra obtained varies
between differently treated specimens. Subtle differences in spectral shape are also exhibited. Considering
the composition of the particles, the paramagnetic
species responsible here are most likely oxygen radical
species. Oxygen radicals in dilute systems, where
complicating magnetic interactions are not present,
are well known. All oxygen radical spectra are each
characterized by three tensorial g-values ranging

between 2.0 and 2.4. These values can be determined

from the resulting complex spectra, with several welldefined maxima and minima. In our case, these
complexities averaged out and are not observed. This
may come about for several reasons. First, in our case
the number of oxygen radicals is large, implying strong
dipole–dipole and exchange interactions. Some radicals may be especially close together due to structural
considerations. In view of the glass-forming ability of
silica, there are also likely to be wide structural
variation between the sites of the several different
radical species in question, such as {O–, O 2 –, (O–)2,
(OO)–} [16]. In addition considerable molecular
motion may be taking place, so that structural reorientation on the microwave period time scale also
contributes to broadening.
A detailed analysis of the spectra is presently in
progress, and will be presented elsewhere. For present
purposes, we have used the normalized spectra to
monitor the oxygen radical content present in arbitrary
units (a.u.) in Table 1. Power saturation and over
modulation were determined to be absent. These

radicals are presumed to be associated mostly with
the particle surface. Significantly, we did not observe
any E’ centers associated with the silica particles. The
EPR spectrum of this oxygen vacancy defect is very
narrow, implying better detectability at very low
content compared to oxygen radicals. The untreated
silica nanoparticles have a much higher signal than the
micron scale particles indicating much higher diatomic
oxygen content. The surface-treated nanoparticles
have an EPR signature similar to the micron scale
particles, suggesting that the oxygen radicals were
partly eliminated during the surface treatments. The

number of radicals increases when the particles are
incorporated into the polymer. This is true for all types
of particles. Although the resurgence of oxygen radicals is lower for the surface-treated nanosilica fillers
compared to the untreated nanosilica fillers, the trend
of increasing oxygen radicals in the composites is
evident.
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to investigate the surface chemistry characteristics for all the nanoparticles and microparticles. XPS
analysis was done on a Perkin Elmer (Model # 5500)
using MgK a monochromatic radiation. Data were
gathered before argon cleaning and after 3 min,
6 min and 9 min of argon cleaning; it was found that
the data were similar in peak position and intensity.
Data gathered were analyzed using Auger Scan-2
software, which employs a linear least squares optimization with a simplex peak-fitting algorithm. XPS
analysis indicated that the surface of the particle
contains mainly oxygen and silicon for the untreated
particles and traces of nitrogen, in addition, for the
surface treated particles. The four possible chemical
structures of silicon in its four oxidation states (Si [+],
Si [2+], Si [3+] and Si [4+] ) were considered for analyzing the
XPS data. The corresponding Si 2p binding energies
were taken from the literature [17] and are given in
Table 2. The Si-2p peak is fitted with a symmetrical
Gaussian fit and in each fit the alternative peak
positions were kept at the same width while the

where n is the oxidation state of silicon and H is the

( 1:1 ratio with silicon) and lower than that of the
untreated nano- and micron-scale silica (~1.3:1 ratio
with silicon).


Electrical characterization


The DC breakdown strength was measured using
recessed specimens with gold electrodes. A conventional 2-parameter Weibull distribution was used to
analyze the breakdown data for samples ranging in
thickness from 0.15 mm to 0.015 mm [18]. The
recessed samples were created using a mold that
allowed 25 samples to be prepared on a single wafer
thereby allowing multiple specimens to be created
simultaneously to permit the large number of breakdown measurements needed to obtain reliable esti
mates of stochastic parameters. The withstand strength
was determined using a high-voltage source with a
ramp rate of 500 V s [–1] applied to the metallized
electrodes in a thermostatically controlled enclosure.
The cumulative probability P of the electrical failure
takes the form of:


b

E
P ¼ 1 � exp � ; ð3Þ

� �E 0 ��


where b is a shape parameter and E 0 is a scale
parameter that represents the breakdown strength at
the cumulative failure probability of 63.2%. Breakdown tests were conducted at four different temperatures (25 �C, 60 �C, 70 �C, and 80 �C).
Long-term voltage endurance tests were carried out
using cylindrical blocks of polymer or polymer nanocomposites, embedded with a tungsten electrode of tip
radius, r, of approximately 4 lm (for a highly divergent
field) and 12 lm (for a less divergent field), with an
inter-electrode distance, d, of ~2 mm. The samples
were stressed with a 60 Hz alternating voltage, and the
tip stress, E, was calculated from the applied voltage
using the relationship [1]:

2V
E ¼ ð4Þ
r lnð4d=rÞ [:]


The microcomposite voltage endurance was not
tested because of its known poor breakdown perfor
mance.

Dielectric spectroscopic measurements of the samples were completed at 25 �C, 60 �C, 70 �C, and 80 �C
using a Novocontrol Alpha Analyzer (type K) in
combination with a Novocontrol active BDS-1200

sample cell. The laminar samples were approximately
0.5 mm thick with a gold electrode sputtered onto a
circular area of 2.2 cm in diameter.
Thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements
were used to investigate the nature and the origin of
charge carrier traps. The base polymer (XLPE) is well
characterized using TSC [19]. TSC measurements were
performed using laminar samples of thickness ~100 lm
with sputtered deposited platinum electrodes on both
sides. The poling temperature used for all samples was
60 �C and the temperature ramp rate for the TSC
measurements was 2 �C/min from 40 �C to 100 �C.

From the two sets of samples tested for each type of
material, the peak position was found to be reproducible within ±1 �C.

When a DC field is applied to a finite thickness of
non-ideal dielectric sandwiched between two plane
parallel electrodes, the current decays slowly over
time. This slowly decreasing current is referred to as
the ‘absorption current’ or ‘anomalous current’.
Absorption current measurements were performed
utilizing a Keithley 8009 Resistivity Test Fixture on
laminar samples of thickness from 50 lm to 500 lm
over a range of electric fields from 10 [5] V/m to
3 · 10 [7] V/m, and all measurements were performed
at room temperature (298 ± 3 �K).



Results


One of the key factors controlling the electrical
behavior in filled polymers is the particle dispersion.
An extensive study of dispersion is not reported here,
but the dispersion for all the samples was similar as
observed using scanning electron microscopy. Small
clusters of particles were observed (5–10 particles) but
many of the particles were isolated. As mentioned,
crystallinity can also affect the breakdown strength.
Prior differential scanning calorimetry [15] data
showed that the percent crystallinity is about 40% for
the unfilled, micron scale composites, untreated nanoscale silica, AEAPS, and HMDS treated silica nanocomposites. The crystallinity for the vinylsilane-treated
(TES) silica nanocomposites was about 60%. Previous
reports [15] have shown that percent crystallinity is not
a primary parameter in the behavior of these materials.
The characteristic breakdown strength for XLPE at
room temperature is found to be about 270 kV/mm,
which is comparable to published values [20]. There is
a dramatic increase in breakdown strength for the
untreated nanofilled composites over the micron-filled
counterparts shown in Fig. 3. There is an incremental
improvement in breakdown strength for the AEAPS
and HMDS nanosilica composites. The TES nanosilica
filled composites exhibit a still higher breakdown
strength. In addition, the TES nanocomposite retained
50% of its breakdown strength at 80 �C, while the
other composites saw a 70% decrease (Table 3).
The superior performance of the nanofilled material
over the base resin is best demonstrated by a voltage
endurance test. Figure 4 shows the relationship between electrode tip-stress versus lifetime. For tip
stresses above 500 kV/mm, the XLPE breaks down
almost immediately (within a matter of two hours,

which is reduced to less than an hour at 600 kV/mm).
In contrast, the filled materials exhibit a time to failure
which is two orders of magnitude higher than the base
resin. It is clear that the less divergent (more uniform)
field specimens (represented as open symbols in Fig. 4)
and the more divergent field specimens lead to similar
endurance times at lower tip stress. Again, there was
an incremental improvement in endurance time exhibited by the surface treated silica nanocomposites.

approximately 2.23 (at 60 Hz). This is a little higher
than the unfilled material. The microcomposites exhibited a much higher value of 3.14 suggesting that some

however, showed values lower than that of the base
resin (2.2). This is true at all temperatures (not shown
in the figure). Figure 5(b) compares the loss tangent of
the micron scale composites and nanocomposites. The

broad loss peak, which appears in the micron scale
composites, is completely eliminated for all the nanocomposites. The nanoparticles appear to reduce the
chain movement of the polymer through physical
bonding or through confinement. In the case of
untreated nanocomposites, the permittivity is unchanged for a given temperature for a wide range of
frequency (0.1 Hz–1 MHz), but starts to increase due
to ‘quasi-DC’ conduction [24] at lower frequencies.
This ‘quasi-DC’ conduction at low frequency has been
explained by Lewis [9] utilizing O’Konski’s model [25]
and a double layer approach. By this model, charge
carriers are efficiently transferred around the interface
by the field leading to an induced polarization at the
polar ends of the particle which becomes a large
dipole. This will lead to a dielectric constant higher
than the particle itself. Since these double layer effects
are likely to be pronounced in nanocomposites, the
slope of the permittivity is steeper than for the
microcomposite (which also has untreated fillers) in
the low frequency region.
The real part of the permittivity (Fig. 5(a)) of the
AEAPS and HMDS surface-treated nanosilica com
posites contains a peak above 1 Hz not present in the
other materials. These peaks are not characteristics of
adsorbed water, which shows a peak around 1 Hz,
implying that they originate due to the surface modifiers. On the other hand, the tan d behavior of the
surface-treated nanocomposites is very different from
the untreated nanocomposite (Fig. 5(b)) in the low
frequency region. The slope of the ‘quasi-DC’ part
demonstrated in the untreated nanofilled composite is
completely absent in the surface-treated nanocomposites, suggesting that the conducting sheath present in
the case of untreated nanofilled material is substantially affected by the coupling. The activation energy
for the low frequency dispersion was calculated by the
normalization method [24] by shifting the imaginary
part of the frequency spectra laterally and then
determining the frequency shift required to bring the
curves into coincidence. The activation energy for each
composite in Table 4 shows that the two polar surface

modified nanocomposites have a higher activation
energy than the untreated and TES treated nanocomposites and marginally higher than microcomposite.
Figure 6 shows TSC spectra for all the materials.
Both the microcomposite and the untreated nanocomposite show a peak at ~54 �C. For the base polymer, a
peak appears in a similar temperature region and is
referred to as the C 4 peak [19], which originates from
the amorphous–crystalline interface of the polymer.
However, at higher temperatures, the TSC spectra for
the microcomposite and untreated nanocomposite are
different. The smaller peak at 78 �C for the untreated
nanocomposite is overshadowed by a rapid increase in
current in the microcomposite. This increase in current
is attributed to Maxwell–Wagner interfacial polarization and this peak is identified as the q-peak. Charges
trapped at the interface of microparticles are responsible for such peaks [1]. Figure 6 also depicts the TSC
spectra for the surface treated nanocomposites. The
TES nanocomposite which shows a peak at similar
temperature to the C 4 -peak shown by the untreated
nanocomposites, but shifted upward ~5 �C. The shift in
the peak is attributed to the higher viscosity of TES
nanocomposites compared to the base polymer and the
untreated nanocomposites (not shown here). The
height of the peak for the TES nanocomposites is
roughly similar to that of the untreated nanocomposite.
The AEAPS and HMDS treated composites show
similar behavior to the untreated nanocomposite at
low temperatures, but the C 4 peak is shifted slightly to
lower temperatures (51 �C for the AEAPS nanocomposites and 47 �C for the HMDS nanocomposite). At
higher temperatures, however, they both show a clear

with deep trap sites.

To investigate the nature of the trapping, the depth
of the trap sites was evaluated using the ‘initial rise
method’ [26]. A temperature range of 0.95–0.98 T m
(where T m represents the temperature where a TSC
peak is observed for a particular sample) was selected
for evaluation of trap depth, as this range is likely to
give the best accuracy of the results [26]. The trap
depth was determined from the slope of an Arrhenius
plot. Trap depths evaluated using the above method
for both the TSC peaks for all the composites are
shown in Table 5. The trap depth for all the C 4 peaks
for all samples is roughly similar. However, the trap
depth for the second peak of the AEAPS and HMDS
nanocomposites is significantly higher than for the
other composites for which the feature is only just
discernible. These two surface-treated nanocomposites
showed a large peak that dwarfs the structure seen in
this region for all other composites, which was ascribed
to the formation of novel trap sites due to the polar
nature of the surface modifier groups. The depth of
these traps is also similar to the trap-depth introduced
by amine molecules in polyethylene [27], indicating
that the silane coupling agents introduce new trap sites.

Figure 7 shows the absorption current derived for a
2 kV/mm step change in electric field for all the
composites at room temperature over a period of 10 [4] s.
The absorption current is seen to conform to the
following empirical rule


IðtÞ ¼ AðtÞt [�][n] ; ð5Þ


where I is the current, t is the time after application of
the voltage, A(t) is a temperature dependent factor and
n is the slope of the bi-log plot. The most significant
feature of Fig. 7 is the behavior of the unfilled XLPE
and the microcomposite between 200 s and 300 s. They
both exhibit a characteristic reduction in slope, which

Fig. 7 Absorption current for XLPE and all its composites at an
applied field of 2 kV mm [–1]


is attributed to interfacial polarization [28]. This
behavior is observed only in the base polymer and
the microcomposite up to an applied field of 10 kV/

mm.

where l is the mobility of the charge carriers, d is the
sample thickness, t p is the time at which absorption
current is at its maximum (peak), and V is the applied
voltage. This method relies on the transient space
charge limited current characteristics in polyethylene
which generates a peak in the current at a given time,
t p, due to the arrival of a space charge front following
transport from the source electrode [29]. Such peaks
may be seen in Fig. 7 at 2 kV/mm, but become more
pronounced at higher fields. The calculated mobility of
the charge carriers within a field range of 0.1–9 kV/mm
is shown in Fig. 8. For all the nanocomposites the
mobility decreases while for the microcomposite and
the base polymer it increases with applied field. The
mobility of the charge carriers, also, decreased with
particle loading suggesting that nanoparticles scatter
the carriers reducing their mobility.

Space charge measurements were also reported
earlier for some of these materials [30]. Figure 9 shows
the image charge versus applied field for the space
charge measurements. The point at which the data
begins to deviate from linearity is the point at which
charge injection occurs. Table 6 shows the onset field
for charge injection for each of the materials tested. It

is clear that surface modification of the nanoparticles
resulted in a significant resistance to charge injection,
presumably as a result of a change in the work function
created by the surface layers.


Discussion


There are three properties that all the nanocomposites
have in common. The first is that they all increase the
DC dielectric breakdown strength and voltage endurance compared to the unfilled and micron filled
composite. The second is that they all have reduced
electrical mobility compared to the unfilled and micron
filled composite. This could have two origins:


(a) the large number of small particles and thus the
large interfacial area may act as scattering

centers.
(b) the nanoparticles may alter the crystalline morphology providing another mechanism for scattering (This is particularly so for the TES
modified material for which some nucleation is
likely).


While, it is established that the degree of crystallinity is not, in itself, significant in controlling the
behavior in these systems, charge carriers in the base
polymer can move more easily through the crystalline
phase than the amorphous phase owing to the ordered
structure of the crystalline regions [13]. One may
speculate that the particles within the crystalline phase
tend to disrupt the continuity of the path provided to
the charge carriers, thereby increasing the breakdown
strength. A reduction in mobility in the microcomposite was not observed probably because the micron scale
fillers are too large to be incorporated within the
spherulitic structure and there are far fewer of them to
cause scattering.

A third commonality is the presence of larger
defects in the micron scale composites compared to
the nanocomposites. To understand the effect of
defects in determining the breakdown strength of the
composites, when a chain scission mechanism is operational as proposed by Artbauer [31], an analysis of
breakdown strength dependent on size of the defect
can be conducted. Such defects might originate either
in the bulk of the polymer or in the interface regions of
the particles and the polymer. These defects tend to
have a size distribution, and the maximum size of the
defect present (rather than the average size of the
defects) is critical in determining the breakdown
strength. If the distribution is assumed to be exponential in nature, representing the reality that there will be

a few very large size defects, the probability of finding
a defect of size l would be given by:



gðlÞ ¼ l av exp � [l] ; ð7Þ

� l av �


where l av is the average size of the defects. According
to a chain scission mechanism, failure of the composite
will happen when the size of the defect is larger than a
critical value (l c ), i.e., l > l c . Also, the size of the defect
is inversely proportional to the breakdown strength of
the composite (i.e., l � 1/E). From Eq. (7) the
probability of survival (P S = 1 – P F ) can be
demonstrated as [15]:



P S ¼ 1 � P F ¼ exp �N c exp � [l] ; ð8Þ

� � l av ��


where N c is the total number of defects and l needs to
be at least equal to l c . Following the inverse relation
between l and E, that is El � 1 (a constant); Equation
(8) can be re-written as:



1 � P F ¼ exp �N c exp � [El] : ð9Þ

� � E c l av ��


Equation 9 suggests that by replotting the breakdown data (that has reached its E c ) in the form of ln(–
ln[1 – P F ]) versus 1/E should give the information
about the size of the defects. Such a plot is shown in
Fig. 10, where the data points originating from the set
of breakdown measurements of one type of sample fall
onto a line. However, the slope of the fitted line for the
microcomposite is significantly lower than both the
nanocomposites and the base resin. Since the slope
represents the size of the defects, this suggests that the

microcomposite must have a much larger defect size
distribution than the nanocomposites and the base
polymer.
It now remains to discuss the differences between

the nanocomposites due to functionalization. These
differences, however, must be a minority effect as they
do not lead to the order of magnitude effects seen due
to the incorporation of nanofillers. Consider first the
untreated nanocomposite. In this case, the dielectric
spectroscopy results hint at a ‘‘quasi-conductive’’ layer

[9]. This is supported by the very high oxygen defect
concentration (Table 1) and the higher absorption
current compared to the other nanocomposites. In this
case, the quasi-conductive layer probably modifies the
breakdown strength by creating local conductivity that
might be expected to reduce the internal space charge.
Because of the low concentration of filler, these locally
conductive regions do not overlap and thus do not
cause early global breakdown, but provide a mechanism for reducing the local field.
The surface treated nanocomposites do not exhibit
this ‘‘quasi-conductive’’ layer, but they do exhibit two
significant differences compared to the untreated nanofiller. First, the polar surface treatments (AEAPS and
HMDS) have shown through TSC to have very deep
trap sites. Ieda et al. [14] measured similar trap depths
in polyethylene through the introduction of amine
groups and so it is likely that this phenomenon is the
result of the polar surface modifier groups. In turn, this
would suggest that the mobilities shown in Fig. 8 are
trap dominated, and it is no coincidence that the lowest
mobilities are exhibited by the functionalized materials
that provide deep trap sites. The reduced mobility could
contribute to increased breakdown strength. Finally, all
the surface treated nanofillers exhibit a higher onset
field for charge injection. While this data is significant, at
this point, the reasons for this behavior are not clear and
are currently under investigation.


Conclusions


1. The addition of nanoscale silica to XLPE leads to

an order of magnitude increase in breakdown
strength compared to micron scale filler, and at
least a 20% increase compared to unfilled XLPE.
However, at elevated temperature, appropriate
functionalization can lead to enhancements in

breakdown strength in excess of 175% with this
technology.
2. The addition of nanoscale silica to XLPE leads to

two orders of magnitude improvement in the
voltage endurance compared to unfilled XLPE.

3. The most likely mechanism that could be used to
explain the increase in breakdown strength in the
nanocomposites is the scattering created by both
particle/polymer interfaces and possibly disrupted
crystalline structure.
4. The data suggest that the mechanism leading to the
decrease in breakdown strength for the micron
scale filler is because of the introduction of defects
created by the micron scale fillers.
5. The mechanism leading to the subtle differences in
breakdown strength due to surface treatment of
the nanofillers is either due to the defect reduction
via chemical linkage between particle and polymer
or, due to the introduction of deep trap sites in the
polymer due to the surface modifier groups.
