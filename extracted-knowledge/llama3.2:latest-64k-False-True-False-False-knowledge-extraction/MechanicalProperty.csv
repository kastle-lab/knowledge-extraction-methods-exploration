This code snippet uses regular expressions to split the publication content into sentences and then tokenizes each sentence into words. It checks if any of the words match a schema triple subject or predicate","extracts the subject","predicate, and object from the sentence, and adds the extracted triple to the list.

Note that this is just an example implementation and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your use case."
