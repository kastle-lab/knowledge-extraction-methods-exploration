"Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is explicitly mentioned in several sections","including measuring cooling rates and crystallinity. So","connecting DSC to its calorimetry characteristic **CoolingRate** fits the publication's content."
"Other microscopy types like TEM might not be covered here","but if any were","they'd need direct references from SEM discussions."
