"First I need to understand both the schema and the publication content thoroughly. The schema has various (subject","predicate","object) patterns like:"
"But I must avoid including any triple that requires hypothetical data - only what can be clearly extracted from tables","text mentions of units/quantities","and explicitly stated material properties."
