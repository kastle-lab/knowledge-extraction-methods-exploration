"Okay","I need to extract factual data triples from this publication that match the schema provided. First","I'll look at each part of the publication carefully."
"Starting with the abstract and introduction sections: They mention breakdown strength increases (like ""order of magnitude increase"") and voltage endurance improvements (""two orders of magnitude""). These seem like direct numerical values related to specific materials or conditions. For example","comparing XLPE alone vs. nanocomposites gives an increase from 270 kV/mm to around 450 kV/mm. Also","mentioning the effect of different fillers (micron vs. nano) on breakdown strength."
"Characterization methods and their results: EPR","XPS","dielectric spectroscopy all provide specific measurements like oxygen radical concentrations or trap depths. Tables might contain statistical data that can be mapped to subject-predicate-object triples."
"I need to ensure that each triple extracted is either explicitly stated or strongly inferable. For example","the relationship between treated fillers and higher onset fields can be inferred from specific data points mentioned earlier. Similarly","comparing nanocomposites' properties against micron scale composites requires mapping direct statements from the publication about these differences."
