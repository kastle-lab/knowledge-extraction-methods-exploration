"First","I need to understand the structure of both the schema and the publication provided. The schema includes various subject-predicate-object relationships with some being classes like `Experiment` subclassed under `NodeWithAttributes`","while others define attributes such as `Funding` having a string value or specific types related to equipment and processes."
"### Results Figure 5(a) and (b) show the change in permittivity and tan d as a function of frequency at 25 °C for the base resin as well as the micron filled and nanofilled XLPE. The predicted permittivity of composites with 5 wt% of filler calculated using the Lichtenecker–Rother logarithmic formula [21]","Maxwell–Garnet random mixing formula [22]","and Landau–Lifshitz power law formula [23]."
"The nanocomposites","however","showed values lower than that of the base resin (2.2). This is true at all temperatures (not shown in the figure). Figure 5(b) compares the loss tangent of the micron scale composites and nanocomposites."
