"Notes","Abstract of the paper as xsd:string","The addition of nanoscale silica to XLPE leads to an order of magnitude increase in breakdown strength compared to micron scale filler, and at least a 20% increase compared to unfilled XLPE. However, at elevated temperature, appropriate functionalization can lead to enhancements in breakdown strength in excess of 175% with this technology. The addition of nanoscale silica to XLPE leads to two orders of magnitude improvement in the voltage endurance compared to unfilled XLPE. The most likely mechanism that could be used to explain the increase in breakdown strength in the nanocomposites is the scattering created by both particle/polymer interfaces and possibly disrupted crystalline structure. The data suggest that the mechanism leading to the decrease in breakdown strength for the micron scale filler is because of the introduction of defects created by the micron scale fillers. The mechanism leading to the subtle differences in breakdown strength due to surface treatment of the nanofillers is either due to the defect reduction via chemical linkage between particle and polymer or, due to the introduction of deep trap sites in the polymer due to the surface modifier groups."
