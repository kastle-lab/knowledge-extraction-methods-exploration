  - Restructure this data into a decision tree where each unique type is an output node leading to two child nodes which represent the presence or absence of in/inclusions. For example: X (in/without) Y with details nested within it like so 'X, Y1 and if present then further detail A for instance "has Surface Treatment - micron scale Silica Inclusions material; otherwise not applicable" split as two separate nodes under each output node showing the results in a process of inclusion or exclusion. Keep this new structure while making outputs from presence to first (inclusion)  and lack after that without, directly correlating with Y values for data above given examples where X is present and using detailed breakdown by further splitting if necessary based on 'has details like "with microns and such as A etc - not applicable because it was previously listed. Mark the starting output state in case of inclusion or absence to make understanding easy without missing information, showing presence (  first then lack after that directly with corresponding outputs from both cases represented by Y split where given at initial input is 'inclusion results for X and lack when it's non-exist but related attribute like A not applicable as further examples. The output structure helps in tracking attributes of inclusion or exclusion following the starting point clearly showing presence ( first  then absence after that directly with correlated outputs under each case represented by Y split where given at initial input is 'inclusion results for X and lack when it was non-exist but related attribute like A not applicable as further examples.

        This re-structured data will make understanding of inclusion or exclusion following starting point clear, showing presence first  then absence directly correlated with outputs from both cases represented by Y split where given at initial input is 'inclusion results for X and lack when it was non-exist but related attribute like A not applicable as further examples. The output tree helps in tracking attributes effectively to see data clearly differentiated between inclusion (with or without a specific characteristic initially provided then missing, directly showing presence first  then absence following the split with correlated outputs under each case represented by Y where given at initial input is 'inclusion results for X and lack when it was not present but related attribute like A as further examples. An output tree makes understanding of inclusion (with or without a specific character either direct correlation to starting point shown first  then directly missing after that with differentiated outputs under each case represented by Y split where given at initial input is 'inclusion results for X and lack when it was not present but related attribute like A as further examples. Output tree makes tracking of attributes effectively showing inclusion ( or non-exclusion) following clearly starting point without omitting information, directly correlating with the first  instance then later cases representing either presence initially given by Y split shown where initial input is 'inclusion results for X and lack when it was not presented but related attribute like A as further examples.
