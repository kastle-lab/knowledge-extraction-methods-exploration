"3. **Role of Particle Interfaces and Crystallinity**: The primary mechanisms believed responsible include the large interfacial area created with nanoparticles (which could cause scattering)","disrupted crystalline structures within XLPE due to nanoparticle inclusion which affect charge carrier mobility negatively","but potentially positively impact overall breakdown strength by reducing local fields."
"4. **Functionalization Impact on Breakdown Strength and Voltage Endurance**: Different surface treatments of silica particles showed that polar groups can create deep trap sites in the polymer matrix through chemical bonding or functionalization with amines (or similar compounds)","leading to a decrease in charge mobility","which could contribute significantly towards increased breakdown strength."
