"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The samples meant for electrical testing were metallized with 150 A of sputtered gold."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","All samples were loaded with 5 wt% of nanoparticles."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The particles and polyethylene were melt mixed until the aggregate size was less than 100 nm as measured using scanning electron microscopy."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The samples were post-cured under vacuum which is important since cross-linking byproducts may otherwise affect the electrical properties."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Melt processing and post-cure annealing are likely to mitigate the presence of pre-existing electric charge."
