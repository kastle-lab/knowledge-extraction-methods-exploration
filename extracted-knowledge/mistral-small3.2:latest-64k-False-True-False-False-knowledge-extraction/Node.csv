"Materials Science and Engineering Department","hasNotes","The incorporation of silica nanoparticles into polyethylene has been shown to increase the breakdown strength significantly compared to composites with micron scale fillers. Additionally, the voltage endurance of the nanocomposites is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the base polymer."
