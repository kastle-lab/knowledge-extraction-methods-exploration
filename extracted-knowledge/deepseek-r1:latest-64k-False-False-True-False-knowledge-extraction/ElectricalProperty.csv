"The results section has detailed measurements on permittivity and loss tangent at various frequencies and temperaturesâ€”this can populate RealPermitivity","LossTangent subclasses under ElectricalProperty. They also mention activation energy from dielectric spectroscopy (Table 4)","so that's part of EnergyDensity properties."
