"First","I am considering the user's query. They want me to act as an expert knowledge extraction analyst and review the given schema triples against the scientific publication. The goal is to extract only parts of the publication that can realistically populate the given schema triples","meaning there should be clear evidence in the content that supports filling in for each triple."

"- PhysicalProcess","subclassOf","Process: This is generally true based on context since the processes are material-based and experimental."
"But the triples don't specify exact subjects; they use general terms like 'Process'. However","for extraction","I think we're supposed to extract sentences that describe processes and their attributes as per schema."
