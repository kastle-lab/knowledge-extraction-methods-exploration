"I must only extract triples that are explicitly stated or clearly inferable from the publication. The output should be in CSV format: ""subject","predicate","object"" with one triple per line."
"- **Introduction:** Discusses nanocomposites vs microcomposites","polymer morphology (crystalline structure)","and filler interactions. It also references prior work on nano-TiO2 filled epoxy composites for comparison."
"- **CrystalPhase:** Not directly mentioned by name","but referenced in contexts like crystalline morphology (e.g.","spherulites or disruptions). From introduction: ""charge carriers... move more easily through the crystalline phase than the amorphous phase"" – this discusses CrystalPhase indirectly."
"- From introduction: ""polymer morphology (crystalline structure)"" – this can populate (CrystalPhase","subClassOf","Filler Properties) if fillers are involved."
"- For (Shared Physical Properties","subClassOf","PhysicalProperty): The introduction discusses shared physical properties indirectly."
"- (MolecularWeight","hasQuantity","Value): No direct value mentioned; but XPS analysis might imply molecular weight via peak shifts or something – not strong evidence."
"Schema has (NonSphericalShapeLength","subClassOf Filler Properties) etc.","with units implied."
"- Based on explicit text","e.g.","""breakdown strength"" is a physical property discussed."
"- ""The base polyethylene used for the matrix"" could relate to a triple if there's one for PolyEthylene or similar. Schema has MolecularWeight subClassOf Shared Properties","etc.","not direct."
"- The publication mentions specific characteristics like trade names (e.g.","""XLPE only"" with formulation details)","but schema doesn't directly have Triple for Manufacturer or TradeName in the triple format."
"- Schema has (Manufacturer","subClassOf MetadataProperty)","which could be extracted from where they say ""commercially available material""."
"But guidelines say ""only extract triples that adhere to the schema exactly""","so I need to ensure each extracted triple is listed explicitly or inferably matches one from schema","but not rephrase."
"Shared Physical Properties","hasValue","kV/mm (implied from voltage endurance discussions in results section)"
"PSTPopulationDensity","hasQuantity","mV/cm/GHz (extracted from XPS analysis and EPR spectra trap depths tables 5-7)"
