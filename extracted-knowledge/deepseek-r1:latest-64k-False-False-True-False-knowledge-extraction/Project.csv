"Finally","verifying that all extractions are factual: ""silica"" is directly mentioned as nanoparticles used; XLPE as part of nanodielectrics; 5 wt% loading from prior work references; node attributes like interface condition discussed but not explicitly linked unless stated. The collection includes cited works and materials tested (micron/nanoscale","treated silica)."
