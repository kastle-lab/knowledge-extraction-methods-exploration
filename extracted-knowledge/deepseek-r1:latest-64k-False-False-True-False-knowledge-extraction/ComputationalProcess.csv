"I must use only text from the publication that explicitly states or clearly infers these relationships. The output should be CSV-style with ""subject","predicate","object"" for each triple on a separate line."
"- Various sections (Electrical Characterization","XPS","EPR) cover experimental and analytical work that could be interpreted as having computational aspects due to data analysis techniques mentioned."
