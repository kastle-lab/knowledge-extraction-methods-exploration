        This is a prompt to generate an extract from multiple choice question in which the context before and after this segment of input:

  The given text has two segments separated by 'Task: Extract out Context, A part that represents contextual information for Task1 and B part represent actual issue with minimum length. Mark output as per format Actual task number As 0 i e.g.

 To extract only segment - Before context For example : After context Given input is "As given in previous examples it will produce following results generate few such cases Ex: Input  Extract out Context A before segment and B after segment Following Output:

 Based on the provided prompt, create at least two different multiple choice questions by carefully considering segments with a format that includes task number (Task1 or Task2) Actual context For example : Given input is - Before "As given in previous examples it will produce following results generate few such cases Ex: Input  Extract out Context A before segment and B after the segment In this case extract first part as contextual information of generation tasks also output format As per your requirement Multiple choice question generated from above segments The contexts are separated by task number, where initial context have to work with given input directly using following examples Given in previous prompt As seen one example 1 Before: [ . This problem is the result of a lack of integration between systems A. causes operational inefficiencies leading to increased costs and risk management issues B.
 Extract out Context A before segment) After : - Task 1 contextual information: this results from not integrating project deliverable with production requirements which increases overall work time as well as complexity in monitoring change control processes As seen, the output generated following multiple choice question of given context is below Output (Task- 2 contextual information: causes operational inefficiencies leading to increased costs and risk management issues; A. lacks integration between systems B.) In this case extracted result after segment contains actual issue that need investigation Given example now generate a new sample based on previous prompt Ex : Input As in earlier examples extract context is " teacher who provides learning resources such as books  .

As per your requirement I made this type output that used provided input With same approach create multiple new context samples In above generated contextual information examples is given below Input - Extract out Context Before segment: teacher who provides learning resources such as books
 extract task 1 contextual information A. facilitates distribution by making subject more interesting to other groups and organizations B.) After the segmented part, generated output contains following segments As per your requirements I created multiple new outputs related with generation tasks Output Task- 1 context after provided prompt is ( teacher who provides learning resources such as books helps in sharing educational material for understanding of concepts A. facilitates distribution by making subject more interesting to other groups and organizations B.) In this type generated contextual information both contexts have task number one where each segment has given input with different segments Given the examples above, below output context contains generation tasks related work process optimization not meeting initial demand which results further complications evaluation As per your requirement Please create at least 5 new multiple choice questions using provided approach Following are five outputs based on generated contextual information Input teacher who provides learning resources such as books is considered a key role in facilitating distribution of educational knowledge to broader groups and organizations A. makes the subject more interesting by sharing it with other students or professional bodies B.
