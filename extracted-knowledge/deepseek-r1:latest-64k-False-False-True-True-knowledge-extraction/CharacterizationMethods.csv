"First","let's find mentions that match CalorimetryCharacteristic subclasses. The publication does mention cooling rate and heating rate in different sections","so those would be valid matches for their respective triples."
"For rheometry results","while the publication mentions measuring viscosity using capillary rheometers at 2 wt% filler concentration","it doesn't provide an exact triple structure matching what's in the schema examples."
