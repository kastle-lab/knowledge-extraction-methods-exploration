"Looking at the provided examples","note that some are more specific than others. However","the schema triple is about `Collection` having various properties."
"In the provided examples","note how some of them use more specific subjects (like `FiberX_2021`) for a property. But our task says: ""Only include triples that adhere to the schema exactly""","meaning we must stick to the given predicate and object types as in the schema."
"- Predicate: varies (subClassOf","hasExperiment","etc.)"
"However","in the provided publication text","there is no explicit mention of a Collection or any triple with the same structure as the schema except through natural language and context."
"1. **Collection","subClassOf","NodeWithAttributes**: There is no direct statement about a collection being a subclass of NodeWithAttributes."
"3. **Collection","hasProject","Project**: The publication mentions a project (the activity funded by EPRI) but no direct triple of that form is given."
"4. **Collection","hasDOI","xsd:anyURI**: No DOI is explicitly stated in the same way (with xsd:anyURI)."
"6. **Collection","hasInventory","Inventory**: Inventory isn't explicitly discussed."
"However","without explicit mentions in the publication text of these exact triple structures","it's difficult to say if any can be extracted."
"Additive","hasQuantity","Quantity -> TiO2_Nanoparticles,hasQuantity,3 wt%"
"In summary","given the strict adherence to the schema and without any explicit mention of `Collection` or its relations (except through natural language)","I cannot extract any triple matching the schema exactly from the publication text you've provided."
