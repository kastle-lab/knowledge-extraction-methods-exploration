"(""ShearStressAtBreak""","""subClassOf""","""MechanicalProperty"") seems supported by the discussion in the introduction about mechanisms controlling electrical characteristics through mechanical interactions. They mention scattering mechanism and changes in space charge distribution due to fillersâ€™ size and surface treatment."
"(""TensileStressAtBreak""","""subClassOf""","""MechanicalProperty"") is supported by their measurements in Table 3 and Fig 4 regarding breakdown strength. They discuss how nanofillers increase these stresses under different conditions."
"(""SampleShape""","""subClassOf""","""MechanicalProperty"") is discussed in the context of MechanicalProperty subclasses. They emphasize sample shape affecting results through hot pressing methods used here."
"Also","in Table 5 regarding Trap Depths (eV) from TSC spectra for different composites","which might relate to MechanicalProperty subclasses indirectly through surface treatments affecting charge trapping mechanisms influencing electrical properties tied to mechanical ones like toughness."
