"Hot pressing","hasDescription","Samples were created by hot pressing and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature keeping the pressure constant"
"Post-curing","hasDescription","Samples were post-cured under vacuum which is important since cross-linking byproducts may otherwise affect the electrical properties"
"Vacuum drying","hasDescription","Particles were vacuum dried for 24 h immediately prior to compounding"
"Melt mixing","hasDescription","Particles and polyethylene were melt mixed until the aggregate size was less than 100 nm"
"Cross-linking","hasDescription","Dicumyl peroxide reacts at temperatures above the compounding temperature creating a cross-linked matrix"
"Cooling","hasDescription","Samples were allowed to cool slowly to room temperature keeping the pressure constant"
