"DC_breakdown_strength","hasNotes","The DC breakdown strength was measured using recessed specimens with gold electrodes. A conventional 2-parameter Weibull distribution was used to analyze the breakdown data for samples ranging in thickness from 0.15 mm to 0.015 mm [18]. The recessed samples were created using a mold that allowed 25 samples to be prepared on a single wafer thereby allowing multiple specimens to be created simultaneously to permit the large number of breakdown measurements needed to obtain reliable estimates of stochastic parameters. The withstand strength was determined using a high-voltage source with a ramp rate of 500 V s [–1] applied to the metallized electrodes in a thermostatically controlled enclosure."
"Thermally_stimulated_current_measurements","hasNotes","Thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements were used to investigate the nature and the origin of charge carrier traps. The base polymer (XLPE) is well characterized using TSC [19]. TSC measurements were performed using laminar samples of thickness  100 lm with sputtered deposited platinum electrodes on both sides. The poling temperature used for all samples was 60 �C and the temperature ramp rate for the TSC measurements was 2 �C/min from 40 �C to 100 �C."
"Absorption_current_measurements","hasNotes","When a DC field is applied to a finite thickness of non-ideal dielectric sandwiched between two plane parallel electrodes, the current decays slowly over time. This slowly decreasing current is referred to as the ‘absorption current’ or ‘anomalous current’. Absorption current measurements were performed utilizing a Keithley 8009 Resistivity Test Fixture on laminar samples of thickness from 50 lm to 500 lm over a range of electric fields from 10 [5] V/m to 3 · 10 [7] V/m, and all measurements were performed at room temperature (298 ± 3 �K)."
