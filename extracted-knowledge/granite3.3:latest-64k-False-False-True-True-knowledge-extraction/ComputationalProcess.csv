"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Abstract: It was found that a reduction in the mobility in nanocomposites as well as a change in the defect size may be key to explaining the improvement in the properties."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Discussion: The mobility of the charge carriers within a field range of 0.1â€“9 kV/mm is shown in Fig. 8. For all the nanocomposites the mobility decreases while for the microcomposite and the base polymer it increases with applied field."
"Notes","asString","Subtle differences in spectral shape are also exhibited. Considering the composition of the particles, the paramagnetic species responsible here are most likely oxygen radical species."
"ComputationalProcess","hasInputData","Data: Characterization of particles: Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were used to detect differences in the particle defect density as a function of surface treatment and composite compounding."
"ComputationalProcess","hasOutputData","Data: All the powdered silica samples and composites (cryo-crushed) were measured using a Bruker ER 042 EPR spectrometer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasInputData","Data: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): XPS analysis indicated that the surface of the particle contains mainly oxygen and silicon for the untreated particles and traces of nitrogen, in addition, for the surface treated particles."
