"Next","considering Schema triples where the subject matter isn't directly stated but inferred from measurements. For example","CalorimetryCharacteristic subClassOf Property is supported by discussions on cooling rates and heating rates in TSC analysis sections (Tables 4-6). This seems inferable as properties discussed influence breakdown strengths."

"- `CapillarySize","RheometryCharacteristic","PolyethyleneRheologyAnalysis` aligns with the paper's description of rheometer capillary size in polymer analysis."
"- `HeatingRate","Property","increasedBreakdownStrength` connects to discussions about higher crystallinity affecting breakdown strength at elevated temperatures (Section 2)."
