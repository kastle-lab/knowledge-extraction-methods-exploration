"Based on the given task","we need to extract factual data triples from the publication that match the provided schema. The schema defines specific relationships expected for a subject called ""Software","but the publication discusses nanocomposites, not software. Therefore, no explicit or clearly inferable triples matching the schema can be extracted.

Here's why each schema pattern does not find a match in the publication:

1. **Software, hasVersion, xsd:string**: The publication mentions versions of formulations but not in the context of software.
2. **Source, asString, xsd:string**: There is no mention of Source"" as an entity with a string representation."
"3. **Software","hasName","xsd:string**: No specific name for any software-like entity is mentioned."
"4. **Software","hasSource","Source**: The publication does not discuss sources related to software."
"5. **Software","subClassOf","Node**: There's no mention of ""Node"" or software being a subclass."
