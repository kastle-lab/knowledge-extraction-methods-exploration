for triple in extracted_triples:

```

This Python code defines a function `extract_triples` that takes the schema and publication as input","extracts the triples from the publication, and returns them as a list of CSV-formatted strings. It uses regular expressions to find matches between the publication text and the patterns defined in the schema.

The output will be:

```
Journal = J Mater Sci
Journal : hasTitle = Candidate mechanisms controlling the electrical characteristics of silica/XLPE nanodielectrics"""
