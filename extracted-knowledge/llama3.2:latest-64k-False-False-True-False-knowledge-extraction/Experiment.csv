"+ Publication extract: Nanocomposite-dielectrics","or nanodielectrics","can exhibit dielectric properties that are better than the base polymer and significantly better than conventional composites with micron scale filler."
"+ Publication extract: Dielectric spectroscopy","absorption current measurements","and thermally stimulated current determinations (TSC) were performed to elucidate the role of the interface."
"+ Object: ""Data"" corresponds to the extracted data mentioned in the publication","such as the TES nanocomposite which shows a peak at similar temperature to the C 4 -peak shown by the untreated nanocomposites","but shifted upward ~5 ï¿½C."
"+ Object: ""Process"" corresponds to the extracted process mentioned in the publication","such as surface-treated nanoparticles have an EPR signature similar to the micron scale particles","suggesting that the oxygen radicals were partly eliminated during the surface treatments."
"+ Object: ""Location"" corresponds to the extracted location information mentioned in the publication","such as The details of sample formulations are discussed in [15]. In brief","the particles were vacuum dried for 24 h immediately prior to compounding."
