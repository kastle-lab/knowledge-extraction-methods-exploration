"Notes","asString","The incorporation of silica nanoparticles into polyethylene has been shown to increase the breakdown strength significantly compared to composites with micron scale fillers. Additionally, the voltage endurance of the nanocomposites is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the base polymer."
"Notes","asString","Nanocomposite-dielectrics, or nanodielectrics, can exhibit dielectric properties that are better than the base polymer and significantly better than conventional composites with micron scale filler. For example, an increase in dielectric strength and an accompanying reduction in space charge has been documented for the case of nano-TiO 2 filled epoxy resin compared to micron scale TiO 2 filled epoxy composites [1] and titania filled low density polyethylene (LDPE) composites compared to micron scale TiO 2 filled LDPE composites [2]."
"Notes","asString","Polyethylene–SiO 2 composites were formulated using micron and nanoscale particulates. The base polyethylene used for the matrix is a commercially available material used in the manufacturing of high-voltage (HV) extruded cross-linked underground cables. It contains antioxidants (non-ionic and hence, do not contribute to the base polymer conductivity) and a cross-linking agent, dicumyl peroxide (DCP), which reacts at temperatures above the compounding temperature creating a cross-linked matrix."
"Notes","asString","Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were used to detect differences in the particle defect density as a function of surface treatment and composite compounding. All the powdered silica samples and composites (cryo-crushed) were measured using a Bruker ER 042 EPR spectrometer."
"Notes","asString","The DC breakdown strength was measured using recessed specimens with gold electrodes. A conventional 2-parameter Weibull distribution was used to analyze the breakdown data for samples ranging in thickness from 0.15 mm to 0.015 mm [18]. The withstand strength was determined using a high-voltage source with a ramp rate of 500 V s [–1] applied to the metallized electrodes in a thermostatically controlled enclosure."
"Notes","asString","One of the key factors controlling the electrical behavior in filled polymers is the particle dispersion. An extensive study of dispersion is not reported here, but the dispersion for all the samples was similar as observed using scanning electron microscopy. Small clusters of particles were observed (5–10 particles) but many of the particles were isolated."
"Notes","asString","There are three properties that all the nanocomposites have in common. The first is that they all increase the DC dielectric breakdown strength and voltage endurance compared to the unfilled and micron filled composite. The second is that they all have reduced electrical mobility compared to the unfilled and micron filled composite."
"Notes","asString","1. The addition of nanoscale silica to XLPE leads to an order of magnitude increase in breakdown strength compared to micron scale filler, and at least a 20% increase compared to unfilled XLPE. However, at elevated temperature, appropriate functionalization can lead to enhancements in breakdown strength in excess of 175% with this technology."
"Notes","asString","2. The addition of nanoscale silica to XLPE leads to two orders of magnitude improvement in the voltage endurance compared to unfilled XLPE."
"Notes","asString","3. The most likely mechanism that could be used to explain the increase in breakdown strength in the nanocomposites is the scattering created by both particle/polymer interfaces and possibly disrupted crystalline structure."
