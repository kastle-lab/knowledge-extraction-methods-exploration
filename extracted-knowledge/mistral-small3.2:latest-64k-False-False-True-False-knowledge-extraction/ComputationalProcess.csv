"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The incorporation of silica nanoparticles into polyethylene has been shown to increase the breakdown strength significantly compared to composites with micron scale fillers."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Additionally, the voltage endurance of the nanocomposites is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the base polymer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The most significant difference between micron-scale and nano-scale fillers is the large interfacial area in nanocomposites."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Because the interfacial region (interaction zone) is likely to be pivotal in controlling properties, this paper compares the behavior of nanoscale silica/cross-linked low density polyethylene nanocomposites with several silica surface treatments."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In addition to breakdown strength and voltage endurance, dielectric spectroscopy, absorption current measurements, and thermally stimulated current determinations (TSC) were performed to elucidate the role of the interface."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","It was found that a reduction in the mobility in nanocomposites as well as a change in the defect size may be key to explaining the improvement in the properties."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The particles and polyethylene were melt mixed until the aggregate size was less than 100 nm as measured using scanning electron microscopy."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","All the composites were loaded with 5 wt% of nanoparticles."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The details of sample formulations are discussed in [15]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In brief, the particles were vacuum dried for 24 h immediately prior to compounding."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","All samples were created by hot pressing, and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, keeping the pressure constant."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The samples were post-cured under vacuum which is important since cross-linking byproducts may otherwise affect the electrical properties."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The samples meant for electrical testing were metallized with 150 A [˚ ] of sputtered gold."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Melt processing and post-cure annealing are likely to mitigate the presence of pre-existing electric charge."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were used to detect differences in the particle defect density as a function of surface treatment and composite compounding."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","All the powdered silica samples and composites (cryo-crushed) were measured using a Bruker ER 042 EPR spectrometer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In the simplest case, the resonance condition is given by: Hm ¼ gbH; ð1Þ where H is the magnetic field, b is the Bohr magneton, and m is the frequency of the microwave radiation, and g is the Lande factor."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","For a spin only electron, g = 2.0023."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The magnetic field was measured using a Walker Hall probe Tesla meter, the instrument being set at one value using the resonance of diphenyl picryl hydrazyl (dpph), which has a g value of 2.0034, as a standard."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The magnetic field values are accurate to within 0.01%."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The spectrometer measures the derivative of the absorption at X-band, the frequency, being in the range 9.77 GHz."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","We show the derivative spectrum of untreated silica nanoparticles (Fig. 2). This spectrum is typical of all spectra obtained from our different samples."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The overall magnitude in the spectra obtained varies between differently treated specimens."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Subtle differences in spectral shape are also exhibited."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Considering the composition of the particles, the paramagnetic species responsible here are most likely oxygen radical species."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Oxygen radicals in dilute systems, where complicating magnetic interactions are not present, are well known."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","All oxygen radical spectra are each characterized by three tensorial g-values ranging between 2.0 and 2.4."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","These values can be determined from the resulting complex spectra, with several well-defined maxima and minima."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In our case, these complexities averaged out and are not observed."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","This may come about for several reasons."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","First, in our case the number of oxygen radicals is large, implying strong dipole–dipole and exchange interactions."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Some radicals may be especially close together due to structural considerations."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In view of the glass-forming ability of silica, there are also likely to be wide structural variation between the sites of the several different radical species in question, such as {O–, O 2 –, (O–)2, (OO)–} [16]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In addition considerable molecular motion may be taking place, so that structural reorientation on the microwave period time scale also contributes to broadening."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","A detailed analysis of the spectra is presently in progress, and will be presented elsewhere."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","For present purposes, we have used the normalized spectra to monitor the oxygen radical content present in arbitrary units (a.u.) in Table 1."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Power saturation and over modulation were determined to be absent."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","These radicals are presumed to be associated mostly with the particle surface."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Significantly, we did not observe any E’ centers associated with the silica particles."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The EPR spectrum of this oxygen vacancy defect is very narrow, implying better detectability at very low content compared to oxygen radicals."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The untreated silica nanoparticles have a much higher signal than the micron scale particles indicating much higher diatomic oxygen content."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The surface-treated nanoparticles have an EPR signature similar to the micron scale particles, suggesting that the oxygen radicals were partly eliminated during the surface treatments."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The number of radicals increases when the particles are incorporated into the polymer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","This is true for all types of particles."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Although the resurgence of oxygen radicals is lower for the surface-treated nanosilica fillers compared to the untreated nanosilica fillers, the trend of increasing oxygen radicals in the composites is evident."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to investigate the surface chemistry characteristics for all the nanoparticles and microparticles."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","XPS analysis was done on a Perkin Elmer (Model # 5500) using MgK a monochromatic radiation."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Data were gathered before argon cleaning and after 3 min, 6 min and 9 min of argon cleaning; it was found that the data were similar in peak position and intensity."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Data gathered were analyzed using Auger Scan-2 software, which employs a linear least squares optimization with a simplex peak-fitting algorithm."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","XPS analysis indicated that the surface of the particle contains mainly oxygen and silicon for the untreated particles and traces of nitrogen, in addition, for the surface treated particles."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The four possible chemical structures of silicon in its four oxidation states (Si [+], Si [2+], Si [3+] and Si [4+] ) were considered for analyzing the XPS data."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The corresponding Si 2p binding energies were taken from the literature [17] and are given in Table 2."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The Si-2p peak is fitted with a symmetrical Gaussian fit and in each fit the alternative peak positions were kept at the same width while the intensity was adjusted."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","From the intensity of the peaks the stoichiometric formula SiO x was calculated using the formula: x ¼ 4 P n i H i / 4 P H i ; ð2Þ where n is the oxidation state of silicon and H is the peak intensity."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","It was found that the oxygen content in all the surface treated nanosilica is of similar level (1:1 ratio with silicon) and lower than that of the untreated nano- and micron-scale silica (1.3:1 ratio with silicon)."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The DC breakdown strength was measured using recessed specimens with gold electrodes."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","A conventional 2-parameter Weibull distribution was used to analyze the breakdown data for samples ranging in thickness from 0.15 mm to 0.015 mm [18]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The recessed samples were created using a mold that allowed 25 samples to be prepared on a single wafer thereby allowing multiple specimens to be created simultaneously to permit the large number of breakdown measurements needed to obtain reliable estimates of stochastic parameters."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The withstand strength was determined using a high-voltage source with a ramp rate of 500 V s [–1] applied to the metallized electrodes in a thermostatically controlled enclosure."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The cumulative probability P of the electrical failure takes the form of: P ¼ 1 � exp � b E / � �E 0 �� ; ð3Þ where b is a shape parameter and E 0 is a scale parameter that represents the breakdown strength at the cumulative failure probability of 63.2%."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Breakdown tests were conducted at four different temperatures (25 �C, 60 �C, 70 �C, and 80 �C)."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Long-term voltage endurance tests were carried out using cylindrical blocks of polymer or polymer nanocomposites, embedded with a tungsten electrode of tip radius, r, of approximately 4 lm (for a highly divergent field) and 12 lm (for a less divergent field), with an inter-electrode distance, d, of 2 mm."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The samples were stressed with a 60 Hz alternating voltage, and the tip stress, E, was calculated from the applied voltage using the relationship [1]: E ¼ 2V / r ln(4d/r) [:]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The microcomposite voltage endurance was not tested because of its known poor breakdown performance."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Dielectric spectroscopic measurements of the samples were completed at 25 �C, 60 �C, 70 �C, and 80 �C using a Novocontrol Alpha Analyzer (type K) in combination with a Novocontrol active BDS-1200 sample cell."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The laminar samples were approximately 0.5 mm thick with a gold electrode sputtered onto a circular area of 2.2 cm in diameter."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements were used to investigate the nature and the origin of charge carrier traps."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The base polymer (XLPE) is well characterized using TSC [19]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","TSC measurements were performed using laminar samples of thickness 100 lm with sputtered deposited platinum electrodes on both sides."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The poling temperature used for all samples was 60 �C and the temperature ramp rate for the TSC measurements was 2 �C/min from 40 �C to 100 �C."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","From the two sets of samples tested for each type of material, the peak position was found to be reproducible within ±1 �C."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","When a DC field is applied to a finite thickness of non-ideal dielectric sandwiched between two plane parallel electrodes, the current decays slowly over time."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","This slowly decreasing current is referred to as the ‘absorption current’ or ‘anomalous current’."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Absorption current measurements were performed utilizing a Keithley 8009 Resistivity Test Fixture on laminar samples of thickness from 50 lm to 500 lm over a range of electric fields from 10 [5] V/m to 3 · 10 [7] V/m, and all measurements were performed at room temperature (298 ± 3 �K)."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","There are three properties that all the nanocomposites have in common."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The first is that they all increase the DC dielectric breakdown strength and voltage endurance compared to the unfilled and micron filled composite."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The second is that they all have reduced electrical mobility compared to the unfilled and micron filled composite."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","This could have two origins: (a) the large number of small particles and thus the large interfacial area may act as scattering centers. (b) the nanoparticles may alter the crystalline morphology providing another mechanism for scattering (This is particularly so for the TES modified material for which some nucleation is likely)."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","While, it is established that the degree of crystallinity is not, in itself, significant in controlling the behavior in these systems, charge carriers in the base polymer can move more easily through the crystalline phase than the amorphous phase owing to the ordered structure of the crystalline regions [13]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","One may speculate that the particles within the crystalline phase tend to disrupt the continuity of the path provided to the charge carriers, thereby increasing the breakdown strength."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","A reduction in mobility in the microcomposite was not observed probably because the micron scale fillers are too large to be incorporated within the spherulitic structure and there are far fewer of them to cause scattering."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","A third commonality is the presence of larger defects in the micron scale composites compared to the nanocomposites."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","To understand the effect of defects in determining the breakdown strength of the composites, when a chain scission mechanism is operational as proposed by Artbauer [31], an analysis of breakdown strength dependent on size of the defect can be conducted."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Such defects might originate either in the bulk of the polymer or in the interface regions of the particles and the polymer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","These defects tend to have a size distribution, and the maximum size of the defect present (rather than the average size of the defects) is critical in determining the breakdown strength."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","If the distribution is assumed to be exponential in nature, representing the reality that there will be a few very large size defects, the probability of finding a defect of size l would be given by: g(l) ¼ l av exp � [l] / � l av � where l av is the average size of the defects."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","According to a chain scission mechanism, failure of the composite will happen when the size of the defect is larger than a critical value (l c ), i.e., l > l c ."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Also, the size of the defect is inversely proportional to the breakdown strength of the composite (i.e., l � 1/E)."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","From Eq. (7) the probability of survival (P S = 1 – P F ) can be demonstrated as [15]: P S ¼ 1 � P F ¼ exp �N c exp � [l] / � � l av �� where N c is the total number of defects and l needs to be at least equal to l c ."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Following the inverse relation between l and E, that is El � 1 (a constant); Equation (8) can be re-written as: 1 � P F ¼ exp �N c exp � [El] : ð9Þ"
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Equation 9 suggests that by replotting the breakdown data (that has reached its E c ) in the form of ln(– ln[1 – P F ]) versus 1/E should give the information about the size of the defects."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Such a plot is shown in Fig. 10, where the data points originating from the set of breakdown measurements of one type of sample fall onto a line."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","However, the slope of the fitted line for the microcomposite is significantly lower than both the nanocomposites and the base resin."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Since the slope represents the size of the defects, this suggests that the microcomposite must have a much larger defect size distribution than the nanocomposites and the base polymer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","It now remains to discuss the differences between the nanocomposites due to functionalization."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","These differences, however, must be a minority effect as they do not lead to the order of magnitude effects seen due to the incorporation of nanofillers."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Consider first the untreated nanocomposite."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In this case, the dielectric spectroscopy results hint at a ‘‘quasi-conductive’’ layer [9]."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","This is supported by the very high oxygen defect concentration (Table 1) and the higher absorption current compared to the other nanocomposites."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In this case, the quasi-conductive layer probably modifies the breakdown strength by creating local conductivity that might be expected to reduce the internal space charge."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Because of the low concentration of filler, these locally conductive regions do not overlap and thus do not cause early global breakdown, but provide a mechanism for reducing the local field."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The surface treated nanocomposites do not exhibit this ‘‘quasi-conductive’’ layer, but they do exhibit two significant differences compared to the untreated nanofiller."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","First, the polar surface treatments (AEAPS and HMDS) have shown through TSC to have very deep trap sites."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Ieda et al. [14] measured similar trap depths in polyethylene through the introduction of amine groups and so it is likely that this phenomenon is the result of the polar surface modifier groups."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","In turn, this would suggest that the mobilities shown in Fig. 8 are trap dominated, and it is no coincidence that the lowest mobilities are exhibited by the functionalized materials that provide deep trap sites."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The reduced mobility could contribute to increased breakdown strength."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","Finally, all the surface treated nanofillers exhibit a higher onset field for charge injection."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","While this data is significant, at this point, the reasons for this behavior are not clear and are currently under investigation."
