"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The voltage endurance of the nanocomposites is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the base polymer."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","The most significant difference between micron-scale and nano-scale fillers is the large interfacial area in nanocomposites."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","a reduction in the mobility in nanocomposites as well as a change in the defect size may be key to explaining the improvement in the properties."
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","an increase in dielectric strength and an accompanying reduction in space charge has been documented for the case of nano-TiO2 filled epoxy resin"
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","electrical voltage endurance was three orders of magnitude higher than that of the base resin"
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","the electrical behavior have been attributed to changes in the space charge distribution"
"ComputationalProcess","hasNotes","a reduction in the internal field caused by the decrease in particle size"
